CRITICAL GAPS (Must Fix)
------------------------
1. Admin Vendor Approval - MISSING
   Frontend calls: POST /admin/vendors/:id/approve, reject, suspend
   Backend: Only has PATCH /admin/vendors/:id/status
   Impact: Vendors cannot be approved

2. Wallet System - COMPLETELY MISSING
   Frontend calls: GET /wallet, POST /wallet/redeem
   Backend: No wallet endpoints
   Impact: Coins system doesn't work

3. Admin Stats Endpoint Mismatch
   Frontend: GET /admin/stats
   Backend: GET /admin/dashboard/stats
   Impact: Admin dashboard won't load

4. Missing Review Moderation
   Frontend calls: DELETE /admin/reviews/:id, PATCH clear-flag
   Backend: Not implemented
   Impact: Admin can't moderate

5. No Customer Review UI
   Endpoints exist but zero frontend implementation
   Impact: Customers can't write reviews
